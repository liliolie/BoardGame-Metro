comments:
  -These codes are clean and well-formatted. The proficient use of the matcher method makes the checking whether given
  -substring (tiles) matches a given regex easier. Also, Array List is frequently used throughout these code, which makes
  -our tile list more flexible and easy to grow and remove. These codes are quite important for the implementation of the
  -metro game.

  -The code is also well-documented. For example, for the task 5 method 2 (e.g., Line 535 – 591 the comments are concise
  -and well summarized what those three parts of codes are for creating total tiles list, remove the tiles from all hands
  -and random a tile from leftover list). This is helpful for our team members or other readers to understand the code
  -and the further optimizing of our code structure.

  -The variables are well named and easy to read, and the name style is consistent throughout the code.

  -There is no error in the code. There are some duplicates codes throughout the code, which is generated the tile list
  -two times. As the tile lists are used in all the task3, task4 and task5, we optimized this part by subtracted these
  -codes into the new Class Tiles, which makes code more cleaner now.
