comments:
  - The best features of this code is that it takes advantage of various methods from other classes, to help create lists
  -  of tile strings and coordinate integers. Second, it uses List to make the placementSequence String easy to manipulate.
  - Third, it thoroughly considers all the special circumstances like "dddd00" to check if a tile in the placemenSequence
  - is in a valid coordinate. Finally, it smartly converts the coordinate strings into integers so that they can be easily
  - conduct arithmetic operations.
  - This code is well-documented that every part in this method is provided with detailed explanation. Others can easily
  - understand what each part does in this code.
  - The program decomposition is appropriate, because it has a clear structure that it checks step by step the conditions
  -  provided in the task description, e.g. overlaping, adjacency, etc. In addition, it reduce the code length by creating
  - helping methods in other classes to make the code concise and easy to understand.
  - The methods in each class as well as all the variables are properly named and consistent throughout the method, which
  - follow the pattern "lowercaseUppercaseFirstLetter". Also, we can easily tell from the variable names what the author
  - is refering to.
  - I currently cannot an error in the code.
