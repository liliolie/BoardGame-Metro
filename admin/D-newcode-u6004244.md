    I contributed the method 1 - 3, and my group member updated the method 1
    a. i learned and used the Pattern to check if the pieceSequence string is following the fixed valid pattern 
    b. i also used the loop to separately check for the characters and numbers in the valid range
    
 2. Metro Class; Lines 375 - 415
    i contributed to the method 2 
    a. i created the array list for different type of tiles
