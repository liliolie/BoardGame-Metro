comments:

The JAR file works well. 
You need to provide authorship details of the code in every class, which is one of the requirements of this deliverable.
The code is well-formatted. Some parts of the code is well-commented,
while some parts need a bit more comments in code. And it would be nice if you could add the description of the function of the classes and methods you created using docstrings.
