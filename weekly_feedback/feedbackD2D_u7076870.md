comments:

Thanks for the sufficient explanation of your code. Youe code is nice and clean, which contributes substantially to the implementation of the Metro game.
It is nice that you create new classes to improve the structure of the design. The code for task 2 is elegant and consise. 
You could improve your code in task 3 by making a better use of data structures. 
It would be better if you could break down your code for task 6 into more helper methods. Also, some code appears to be a bit hardcoding.
I'm not sure if your code covers all the cases for task 6, let's discuss it during the lab.
I'd appreciate if you could comment a bit more to your code, in addition to the explanation written in the admin file.
